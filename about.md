# 🌍 About ContinualAI

Humans possess the extraordinary ability to learn continually from experience—adapting, applying, and building upon knowledge over time. One of the greatest challenges in artificial intelligence is to develop systems that mimic this capability. **Continual learning** aims to create agents that incrementally acquire and refine complex knowledge and skills, enabling them to build a deep understanding of the world.

**ContinualAI** is a registered non-profit research organization and the **largest open community dedicated to Continual Learning for AI**. Our mission is to advance this critical field by connecting researchers, sharing ideas, and producing groundbreaking research to shape the future of AI.
