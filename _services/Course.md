Offered by ContinualAI in collaboration with the University of Pisa and the AIDA Doctoral Academy, this open-access course provides a structured introduction to continual learning, with an emphasis on recent advancements in deep learning. The curriculum includes:

- **Introduction & Motivation**
- **Understanding Catastrophic Forgetting**
- **Scenarios & Benchmarks**
- **Evaluation & Metrics**
- **Methodologies (Parts 1, 2, and 3)**
- **Applications & Tools**
- **Frontiers in Continual Learning**

Designed for graduate and PhD students, this course features recorded lectures, slides, and additional resources available online. Participants can engage with the material at their own pace and have the opportunity to earn a certificate upon completing a project-based exam. **Access the course at [course.continualai.org](https://course.continualai.org).**

### 2. Open World Lifelong Learning Course – Summer 2022

Conducted at TU Darmstadt and powered by ContinualAI and hessian.AI, this course explores continual learning beyond static datasets, covering modern approaches to lifelong learning. Key topics include:

- **Knowledge Transfer, Adaptation, and Continual Learning**
- **Knowledge Retention and Mitigation of Forgetting**
- **Active Learning and Data Selection**
- **Dynamic Neural Architectures**
- **Evaluation Challenges and Metrics**
- **Learning in the Presence of the Unknown**
- **Curriculum Learning**

The course provides lecture slides and recorded sessions, offering a deep dive into the methodologies and applications of continual learning. **Access the course at [owll-lab.com](https://owll-lab.com/teaching/cl_lecture/).**

Both courses are valuable resources for individuals seeking to deepen their understanding of continual learning, providing theoretical insights and practical tools to navigate this evolving field.
