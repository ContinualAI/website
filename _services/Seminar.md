# Seminar Series 2025!

Seminars are gatherings within the ContinualAI community where we discuss topics related to Continual Learning. Each seminar lasts 60 minutes and typically includes 40 minutes dedicated to one or two presentations of recent work, usually delivered by the authors themselves. The seminar will discuss cutting-edge research and practical applications of continual learning models.

The seminars provide a valuable chance to engage in detailed discussions about relevant work and connect with individuals with similar research interests.

Join us every last Thursday of the month for a seminar on the latest advancements in Continual Learning, hosted by ContinualAI.

## Upcoming Seminars:

**Title**: Task-agnostic continual learning for the open world
Thursday, January 30th, at 6 PM CET / 9 AM PT / 12 AM ET
