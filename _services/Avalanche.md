### Key Features of Avalanche
- **Benchmarks**: Access a variety of continual learning benchmarks through a consistent API for streamlined data handling.
- **Training**: Leverage pre-implemented baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms for quick prototyping and comparison of continual learning strategies.
- **Evaluation**: Use built-in tools and metrics to assess algorithms across various metrics crucial to continual learning.
- **Models**: A range of model architectures and pre-trained models suited for continual learning experiments.
- **Logging**: Advanced logging and plotting tools, including native TensorBoard support, for real-time experiment tracking.

By using Avalanche, continual learning researchers and developers can:
- Write less code and **prototype faster** while reducing errors.
- **Improve reproducibility, modularity, and reusability** of their work.
- Increase code **efficiency, scalability, and portability**.
- Amplify the **impact and usability** of their research products.
